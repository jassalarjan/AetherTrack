## Filter Integration

### Dashboard Filters
✅ **Date Range:** Today, Week, Month, Custom, All
✅ **Status:** To Do, In Progress, Review, Done, Archived
✅ **Priority:** Low, Medium, High, Urgent

**How it works:**
1. User changes any filter
2. `applyFilters()` runs and updates `filteredTasks`
3. `updateDetailedStats()` recalculates analytics including teamDistribution
4. Chart automatically updates with new data

### Analytics Filters
✅ **Status:** To Do, In Progress, Review, Done, Archived
✅ **Priority:** Low, Medium, High, Urgent
✅ **Team:** Filter by specific team
✅ **User:** Filter by assigned user
✅ **Date Range:** Today, This Week, This Month, Custom, All

**How it works:**
1. User changes any filter
2. `applyFilters()` updates `filteredTasks`
3. `useEffect` detects change in `filteredTasks`
4. `processAnalyticsData()` recalculates teamDistribution
5. Chart re-renders with filtered data

### Report Filters
✅ **Period:** Daily, Weekly, Monthly, All
✅ **All active page filters** are applied before generating reports

**Excel Report:**
- Includes "Tasks by Team" sheet with filtered data
- Shows only teams with tasks in filtered dataset

**PDF Reports:**
- Both simple and comprehensive PDFs include filtered team data
- Section only appears if teams exist in filtered data

## Technical Details

### State Management
```javascript
// Dashboard & Analytics
const [analyticsData, setAnalyticsData] = useState({
  totalTasks: 0,
  overdueTasks: 0,
  completedTasks: 0,
  inProgressTasks: 0,
  statusDistribution: [],
  priorityDistribution: [],
  teamDistribution: [],  // NEW
  overdueByPriority: [],
  completionTrend: [],
  assigneePerformance: [],
});
```

### Team Distribution Calculation
```javascript
const teamCounts = tasks.reduce((acc, task) => {
  const teamName = task.team_id?.name || 'Unassigned';
  acc[teamName] = (acc[teamName] || 0) + 1;
  return acc;
}, {});

const teamDistribution = Object.entries(teamCounts)
  .map(([team, count]) => ({
    name: team,
    value: count,
  }))
  .sort((a, b) => b.value - a.value);
```

### Chart Configuration
```javascript
// Dashboard
<BarChart data={analyticsData.teamDistribution}>
  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
  <XAxis 
    dataKey="name" 
    angle={-45}
    textAnchor="end"
    height={100}
    interval={0}
  />
  <YAxis />
  <Tooltip />
  <Bar dataKey="value" fill="#10b981" name="Tasks" />
</BarChart>

// Analytics (with color variation)
<Bar dataKey="value" fill="#10b981" name="Tasks">
  {analyticsData.teamDistribution.map((entry, index) => (
    <Cell key={`cell-${index}`} fill={`hsl(${index * 40}, 70%, 50%)`} />
  ))}
</Bar>
```
