   await notificationService.showTaskNotification('assigned', taskObject);
   ```

2. **Check permission:**
   ```javascript
   if (notificationService.getPermissionStatus() === 'granted') {
     // Show notification
   }
   ```

3. **Respect user settings:**

   const settings = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('notificationSettings') || '{}');
   if (settings.taskAssigned) {
     // Show notification
   }
   ```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture:
- **Service Layer**: `notificationService.js` - Singleton pattern

- Padding: `p-3 sm:p-4` → `p-4 sm:p-6`
- Buttons: `w-full sm:w-auto`
- Flex layouts: `flex-col sm:flex-row`
